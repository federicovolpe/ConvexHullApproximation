# Convex Hull Approximation Study

This repository contains all of the work i did with my uni professor on my internship. the project is about finding the perfect algorithm that finds the best approximation of an n-dimensional Convex Hull.

## Examples

Here are some examples of the Convex Hull approximation:

## Overview

The Convex Hull is a fundamental concept in computational geometry, and approximating it efficiently is crucial for various applications. This study explores different algorithms and techniques to find the best approximation of the Convex Hull.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

* `ConvexHull`: contains all the tests done with algorithms that work in 2D. All algorithms are first tested in 2D to avoid wasting time with more complex calculations.
* `Media presentation`: contains all the project images and media used to compose the presentation for my thesis discussion.
* `n_dim_ch`: contains all the code used to run the n-dimensional algorithms using Perl language.
* `tesich`: is the directory used for compiling my thesis document, written in LaTeX.

## Technologies Used

* Perl
* Polymake
* Java
* LaTeX
* PowerPoint
